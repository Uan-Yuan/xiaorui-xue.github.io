✨I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities in Learning Sciences, Education Technologies, and the intersection of cutting-edge technologies with child development.

👩🏻‍💻I currently hold the role of Senior Researcher at [Parent Lab Inc.](https://www.parentlab.com/)

🎓As a graduate of Vanderbilt University with a master's degree in international education policy and management(IEPM), I am equipped with the knowledge and data analysis skills needed to make a positive impact in the field of education.

📖My research interests revolve around leveraging educational technology to enhance child learning and promote educational equity.

📒In addition to my focus on learning sciences, I have broad interests in human-computer interaction, early childhood education, STEM education, spatial ability, and interventions that involve policies, families, schools, and communities.

# Selected Research Experiences

## 💻Linking Eye Movements with Visual Attention to Enhance Cyberlearning（NSF Awarded: 1623625）

I collaborated with Dr. Daniel Levin at the Levin Lab, where we designed coding schemes to investigate the relationship between students' eye movements and learning in authentic classroom environments.

Under the mentorship of Dr. Daniel Levin and Dr. Gautam Biswas, we authored a [respective paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-022-10154-4) published in Educational Technology Research and Development (ETR&D).

## 🧒SRI&PRI: Tennessee Volunteer Pre-K Program 

As a research assistant at the Peabody Research Office, I extensively visited public pre-Ks in Tennessee, observing children's interactions and daily routines. This insight deepened my understanding of curriculum design, staffing, and the challenges these institutions face.

Later, at Stanford Research Institute International, I assessed children individually in public pre-Ks within Metro Nashville public schools, focusing on their social-emotional growth, academic achievements, and language skills.

These two experiences illuminated the substantial performance disparity between students from high-income and low-income regions. This urged me to explore further how settings influence students, encompassing both their academic achievements and the cultivation of social-emotional learning.

I wrote a [policy brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQ7RPy9uthdIGAMH6nhLQLUh4KZXnlrIH0HPyjza99c/edit?usp=sharing) about universal pre-k reforms in the United States.

## 🏙️Education Technology Company 

I led a research team within a prominent ed-tech company, specializing in child development theories. Our work involved crafting curricula tailored for parents and educators, centered around parenting techniques and developmental psychology.

We launched a [parenting education app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parent-lab-daily-parenting-app/id1204077580), aimed to provide bite-sized, personalized parenting practices for caregivers on a daily basis.
