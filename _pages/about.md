✨I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities in Learning Sciences, Education Technologies, and the intersection of cutting-edge technologies with child development.

🎓I graduated from Vanderbilt University.

📖My research interests revolve around leveraging educational technology to enhance child learning and promote educational equity.

📒In addition to my focus on educational technology, I have broad interests in early childhood education, the learning sciences, and interventions that involve policies, families, schools, and communities.

# Selected Experiences

## 💻Linking Eye Movements with Visual Attention to Enhance Cyberlearning（NSF Awarded: 1623625）

I collaborated with Dr. Daniel Levin at the Levin Lab, where I designed coding schemes to investigate the relationship between students' eye movements and learning in authentic classroom environments.

Under the mentorship of Dr. Daniel Levin and Dr. Gautam Biswas, we authored a [respective paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-022-10154-4) published in Educational Technology Research and Development (ETR&D).

## 🧒Tennessee Volunteer Pre-K Program 

As a research assistant at Peabody Research Office, I extensively visited public pre-ks in Tennessee, observing children's interactions and daily routines. This insight deepened my understanding of curriculum design, staffing, and challenges faced by these institutions.

Later, at Stanford Research Institute International, I assessed children individually in public pre-ks within Metro Nashville public schools, focusing on their social, emotional growth and language skills.

These two experiences illuminated the substantial performance disparity between students from high-income and low-income regions. This impelled me to further explore how settings influence students, encompassing both their academic achievements and the cultivation of social-emotional learning.

I wrote a [policy brief](URL: /files/Policy brief.pdf)about universal pre-k reforms in the United States.

## 🏙️Education Technology Company 

I led a research team focusing on theories of child development in one of the leading ed-tech companies, designing curriculums for parents and educators on parenting and development psychology.

We launched a parenting education app, aimed to provide bite-sized, personalized parenting practices for caregivers on a daily basis.
