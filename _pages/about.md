✨I am a Ph.D. student specializing in Educational Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology at the Boston College, where I am advised by Dr. Ido Davidesco. Before joining BC, I obtained my master’s degree in Educational Policy from Vanderbilt University.

👩🏻‍💻Prior to BC, I held the role of Senior Researcher at [Parent Lab Inc.](https://www.parentlab.com/)

📖My research interests center on understanding cognitive processes in learning contexts through the use of eye-tracking and EEG. Specifically, I aim to combine these neurophysiological tools with artificial intelligence to investigate how engagement fluctuates. Ultimately, my goal is to design more personalized and adaptive learning experiences for learners from diverse backgrounds.

📒I am currently working on an NSF-funded project. I am involved in utilizing neurophysiological measures to enhance engagement and learning within Intelligent Tutoring Systems. I am specifically responsible for designing and analyzing the eye-tracking component, aiming to capture real-time engagement fluctuations to inform and improve personalized learning experiences.

# Selected Research Experiences

## 💻Linking Eye Movements with Visual Attention to Enhance Cyberlearning（NSF Awarded: 1623625）

I collaborated with Dr. Daniel Levin at the Levin Lab, where we designed coding schemes to investigate the relationship between students' eye movements and learning in authentic classroom environments.

Under the mentorship of Dr. Daniel Levin and Dr. Gautam Biswas, we authored a [respective paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-022-10154-4) published in Educational Technology Research and Development (ETR&D).

## 🧒SRI&PRI: Tennessee Volunteer Pre-K Program 

As a research assistant at the Peabody Research Office, I extensively visited public pre-Ks in Tennessee, observing children's interactions and daily routines. This insight deepened my understanding of curriculum design, staffing, and the challenges these institutions face.

Later, at Stanford Research Institute International, I assessed children individually in public pre-Ks within Metro Nashville public schools, focusing on their social-emotional growth, academic achievements, and language skills.

These two experiences illuminated the substantial performance disparity between students from high-income and low-income regions. This urged me to explore further how settings influence students, encompassing both their academic achievements and the cultivation of social-emotional learning.

I wrote a [policy brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQ7RPy9uthdIGAMH6nhLQLUh4KZXnlrIH0HPyjza99c/edit?usp=sharing) about universal pre-k reforms in the United States.

## 🏙️Education Technology Company 

I led a research team within a prominent ed-tech company specializing in child development theories. Our work involved crafting curricula tailored for parents and educators centered around parenting techniques and developmental psychology.

We launched a [parenting education app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parent-lab-daily-parenting-app/id1204077580), aimed to provide bite-sized, personalized parenting practices for caregivers on a daily basis.
